# Machine Learning Models used

We tried and experimented with many different types of ML models for the task of Food Demand Forecasting in this project

## Machine Learning Models

### LSTM Model

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is implemented in the `LSTM_model.ipynb` notebook. This model uses a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of learning long-term dependencies, which makes it suitable for time series forecasting.

### Regressor Models

The regressor models are implemented in the `Regressor_models.ipynb` notebook. This notebook contains several regression models, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.

### Time Series Model

The time series model is implemented in the [`time_series_model.py`]. This model uses methods specifically designed for time series data, such as ARIMA and Prophet.

## Running the Models

To run the models, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the libraries with pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the Python scripts with the python command:

```sh
python time_series_model.py
```
And similarly for the other files.
